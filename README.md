# 6502 Computer

This repository is to document my exploration of computer organization by building a breadboard computer using the 6502 microprocessor. My goals for this project is to build the computer itself, understand the fundementals of computer organization and also program simple games. I will start logging tiny blog markdown files for each update to the project and also include resources used like the Ben Eater course, and books I've followed soon enough.
